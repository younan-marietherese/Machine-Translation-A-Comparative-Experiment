# Machine Translation Project

This project focuses on **Machine Translation**, the task of automatically translating text from one language to another using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The project includes preprocessing a large dataset, training machine translation models, and evaluating their performance.

## Project Overview
Machine translation is one of the most impactful applications of NLP, allowing for cross-lingual communication by translating text between languages. In this project, we work with a large dataset to build and evaluate machine translation models. The project involves preprocessing the dataset, implementing translation models, and measuring translation quality using various evaluation metrics.

Due to the large size of the dataset, the data link is referenced in the notebook, but the actual file is not included here.

## Objectives
- Preprocess a large dataset for machine translation.
- Implement and train a machine translation model.
- Evaluate translation performance using metrics like BLEU score.
- Compare rule-based and neural machine translation approaches (optional).

---

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: For implementing machine translation models.
- **TensorFlow/Keras**: For building and training neural machine translation models.
- **Pandas**: For managing the dataset.
- **NLTK**: For tokenization and other NLP tasks.
- **BLEU Score**: For evaluating translation quality.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is a large multilingual text corpus for machine translation. It consists of parallel sentences in different languages, which are used to train and evaluate translation models.

The dataset is referenced via a link in the notebook due to its large size and is not attached to the repository.

## Key Steps

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Load the large machine translation dataset.
   - Clean and preprocess the text, including tokenization, lowercasing, and removing punctuation.
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets for model evaluation.

2. **Modeling**:
   - Implement a neural machine translation model using sequence-to-sequence architectures like LSTM or Transformer models.
   - Optionally, compare the neural approach with a rule-based translation method.
   
3. **Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate the translation quality using **BLEU score** and other relevant metrics.
   - Analyze the results and discuss the strengths and weaknesses of the model.
